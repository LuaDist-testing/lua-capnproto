lua-capnproto
=============

[Capâ€™n Proto](http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/index.html) is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system.

Lua-capnproto is a pure lua implementation of capnproto based on `luajit`.

This project is still under early development and is not production-ready.

Synopsis
========
Suppose you have a Cap'n Proto file called example.capnp. You can compile this file like this:

    capnp compile -olua example.capnp

The default output file is `example_capnp.lua`

    local example_capnp = require "example_capnp"

Check out example/AddressBook.capnp and example/main.lua for how to use generated lua file.

Installation
============
To install lua-capnproto, you need to install Cap'n Proto <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/install.html>, Luajit <http://luajit.org/install.html> and luarocks <http://luarocks.org/en/Download> first.

Then you can install lua-capnproto using the fallowing commands:

    git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-capnproto.git
    cd lua-capnproto
    sudo luarocks make

Let's compile an example file to test whether lua-capnproto was installed sucessfully:

    capnp compile -olua proto/example.capnp

Normally, you should see no errors and a file named "proto/example_capnp.lua" is generated.
